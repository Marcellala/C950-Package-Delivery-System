PA for C950 Data Structures and Algorithms II

Task for Western Governors University C950 - Data Structures and Algorithms II

Scenario: The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine the best route and delivery distribution for their Daily Local Deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day; each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements.

Your task is to determine the best algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages, listed in the attached “WGUPS Package File,” will be delivered on time with the least number of miles added to the combined mileage total of all trucks. 

Assumptions:

Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages.
Trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour.
Trucks have a “infinite amount of gas” with no need to stop.
Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.
Drivers leave the hub at 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed. The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.
Delivery time is instantaneous, i.e., no time passes while at a delivery (that time is factored into the average speed of the trucks).
There is up to one special note for each package.
The wrong delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. The correct address is 410 S State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111.
The package ID is unique; there are no collisions.
No further assumptions exist or are allowed.
